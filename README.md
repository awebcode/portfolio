## 👋 About Me  
Hi, I’m **Asikur Rahaman**, a passionate and results-driven **Full Stack Developer** with over four years of experience in building **high-performance, real-time web applications** and **scalable backend systems**. My expertise lies in crafting seamless user experiences by combining modern **frontend frameworks** with efficient **backend architectures**.  

I specialize in working with the latest technologies, including:  
- **Frontend:** React.js, Next.js, Tailwind CSS, ShadCn, Framer Motion  
- **Backend:** Node.js, Nest.js, Express.js, GraphQL  
- **Database & ORM:** PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Prisma ORM, MySQL  
- **CMS & eCommerce:** Payload CMS, Medusa, Shopify  
- **Programming Languages:** JavaScript (ES6+), TypeScript  
- **Authentication & APIs:** OAuth, JWT, REST, WebSockets  
- **DevOps & Tools:** Docker, Git, GitHub, Vercel, Railway, Firebase  
- **Testing:** Jest, Playwright, React Testing Library  
- **CI/CD & Cloud:** Docker, GitHub Actions, Render, AWS  

As an **agile developer**, I thrive in fast-paced, collaborative environments, whether working remotely with global teams or contributing to open-source projects. I’m proficient in **building microservices**, **real-time systems** using **Socket.io**, and developing dynamic, interactive UIs.  

I’m constantly learning and exploring emerging technologies like **Server Components in Next.js**, **GraphQL APIs**, and **headless CMS integrations** to stay ahead of the curve. With a keen eye for **UI/UX design principles**, I enjoy building scalable, responsive, and pixel-perfect interfaces.  

Whether it's architecting **complex eCommerce platforms**, integrating **third-party APIs**, or optimizing **server-side rendering (SSR)** for performance, I take pride in solving real-world problems through code.  

I look forward to contributing to innovative projects, collaborating with talented teams, and helping organizations unlock their full potential through **modern web solutions**.
